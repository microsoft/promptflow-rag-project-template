Increased capital spend will drive higher COGS growth than in FY23, and FY24 operating expense growth will remain low as we prioritize our spend. Therefore, we expect full year operating margins to remain flat year-over-year, even with the headwind from the change in accounting estimate.\\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, we expect our FY24 tax rate to be around 19%.\\\\n\\\\nNow, to the outlook for the first quarter.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point with no impact to \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCOGS growth. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth in Intelligent Cloud by 1 point with no impact to Productivity and Business Processes or More Personal Computing.\\\\n\\\\nIn commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including our renewal and upsell motions, along with long term Azure commitments should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base. \\\\n\\\\nMicrosoft Cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change headwind noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q1 cloud gross margin percentage will be up roughly 1 point primarily driven by improvements in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand.\\\\n\\\\nWe expect capital expenditures to increase sequentially on a dollar basis, as noted earlier, driven by investments in our AI infrastructure.

Even with share gains in our hiring business, growth will continue to be impacted by the overall markets for recruiting and advertising, especially in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. \\\\n\\\\nAnd in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365.\\\\n\\\\nFor Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 15 and 16%, or 14 and 15% in constant currency. Revenue should be $23.3 to $23.6 billion US dollars.\\\\n\\\\nRevenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. \\\\n\\\\nIn Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 25 to 26% in constant currency, including roughly 2 points from all Azure AI services.
