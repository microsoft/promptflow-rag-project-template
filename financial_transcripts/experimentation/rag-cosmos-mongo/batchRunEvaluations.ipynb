Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1 \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ntrends noted earlier. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. \\\\n\\\\nIn our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single digits driven by Enterprise Support. \\\\n\\\\nIn More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.5 to $14.9 billion US dollars. \\\\n\\\\nIn Windows OEM we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nIn Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30 percent, again roughly in line with the PC market. \\\\n\\\\nIn Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. \\\\n\\\\nSearch and news advertising ex-TAC should grow in the low-to-mid teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr.\\\\n\\\\nAnd in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid teens against a strong prior year comparable that included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-to-mid-teens. \\\\n\\\\nNow back to company guidance.\\\\n\\\\nWe expect COGS to grow between 6 and 7 percent in constant currency or to be between $17.4 and $17.6 billion US dollars and operating expense to \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ngrow between 17 and 18 percent in constant currency or to be between $14.3 and $14.4 billion US dollars. As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. \\\\n\\\\nOther income and expense should be roughly $100 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements thru Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility.\\\\n\\\\nAnd we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent. \\\\n\\\\nAnd finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a 2.4-billion-dollar cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in the 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. \\\\n\\\\nNow some thoughts on the full fiscal year.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFirst, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly 5-point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points.  \\\\n\\\\nAt the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20 percent constant currency growth in our commercial business driven by strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings.

Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy costs, we now expect operating margins in US dollars to be down roughly a point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact from the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY23 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. \\\\n\\\\nIn closing, in this environment it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, security, Teams, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers.\\\\n\\\\nAnd while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally, and you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially thru the year while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we\\\\u2019ve made over the last year.\\\\n\\\\nWith that, let\\\\u2019s go to Q&A Brett?\\\\n\\\\nBRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy.

Jessi, can you please repeat your instructions? \\\\n\\\\n(Operator Direction.)\\\\n\\\\nKEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what is obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point, but I think this is what\\\\u2019s on a lot of investors\\\\u2019 minds, is this is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ncame in a little bit below your guidance. And I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is there an inherent volatility in that business that\\\\u2019s just harder to forecast? \\\\n\\\\nAnd on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth, like the glide path for the full year? If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease.\\\\n\\\\nAMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you\\\\u2019ve heard me say it when we\\\\u2019ve been a point better, and you\\\\u2019ve heard me say it when we\\\\u2019ve been a point worse. \\\\n\\\\nAnd I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. \\\\n\\\\nAnd as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are \\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nstill growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so, it\\\\u2019s this nuance of you\\\\u2019re still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth.\", \"symbol\": \"MSFT\", \"fiscal_year\": \"23\", \"fiscal_quarter\": \"1\", \"source\": \"..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\..\\\\\\\\preprocessing\\\\\\\\DATA\\\\\\\\MSFTTranscriptFY23Q1.docx\", \"chunkid\": 9, \"__cosmos_meta__\": {\"score\": 0.856723793852895}}}}]}', 'log_params': {'filter': {'Year': '23', 'Quarter': '1'}, 'topK': 3, 'maxTokens': 3500, 'searchType': 'filter_vector', 'dbName': '${ConfigLoader.output.dbName)'}}\n"
