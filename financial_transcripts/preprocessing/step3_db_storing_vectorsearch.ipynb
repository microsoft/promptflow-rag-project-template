      "AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point better, and you've heard me say it when we've been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on \n",
