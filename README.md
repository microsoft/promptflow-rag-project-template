# Promptflow rag samples 

This repo is a collection of samples on using promptflow and azure ai for development and evaluation of rag applications. 
To run each sample go the specific folder. 

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

Python 3.9 or later,  VSCode, PromptFlow for VSCode extension

## Example walkthrough: RAG on financial transcripts sample 


### Steps

a. steps to run rag app locally in your vscode:

1) Set up your dev environment:
Install miniconda for your environment, here is the link for [windows miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/index.html). Run the following command
`conda env update -f environment.yaml`
2) Make a copy of `.env.sample` and rename it to `.env`. You can use this file to decide to use keys from this file or azure keyvault. The keys will be used for preprocessing in step 3 and creating connections for promptflow in step 4.
```bash
# Use .env or keyvault. ENV or empty = .env, KEYVAULT = keyvault
KEYS_FROM="ENV"
KEY_VAULT_NAME=""
```
> NOTE: Our convention is that variables from keyvault have a (-), but from a `.env` has a (_) like `OPENAI-API-BASE` vs. `OPENAI_API_BASE`
3) cd to the `preprocessing/` folder and start running the preprocessing notebooks to create a new vector database index if you haven't done so already.
4) Create connections for ACS, AOAI, etc by running python code in `connections/` directory.
5) Go to `rag-copilot` directory, open flow.dag.yaml, then choose the connections that you have created. Build locally to deploy the app and interact with the bot in your local environment. 

b. Steps for batch evaluation in vscode:

1) Go to rag-copilot directory, open flow.dag.yaml
2) Click batch run 
3) When selecting input source, choose evalset.csv.
4) Then choose the data mapping on the run yaml file. 
You may either delete topK and maxTokens to use default values or provide integers for the desired values. Do not select them from data mapping as they will not be available
5) The click run on the yaml file. 
Once the run is completed, then you need to
6) Go to evaluator directory and choose one of the folders and open the flow.dag.yaml file. Note that each folder presents one or many evaluation metrics.   
7) Click the batch run to start an evaluation flow. 
8) when prompted, choose "existing run" since we are going to use the results of the main rag flow for the evaluation flow. 
9) Choose the run in step 5 of the evaluation 
10) This will create a run yaml file. You need to uncomment the data to be able to chose the evalset.csv again. You may need to use some columns such as ground truth answers. 
11) Choose the column mapping for the necessary inputs.
12) Note the name of the output file in your terminal.
13) Click on the promptflow icon on the left ribbon of vscode
14) Go to "Batch Run History" section and choose your recent run(s), then click on the Visualize.

c. Steps for experimentation in vscode:

1) Similar to step a.3 open the flow.dag.yaml file. Locate a prompt node and clone it. It will create a new variant and associated jinja file. Make the changes to the prompt in the jinja file. You may also make the changes to the openai variables such as temperature in the cloned node in the flow.dag.yaml. You may create multiple variants for cloneable nodes. Then save the file. 
2) Finally, go through all the steps for the batch evaluations again to obtain evaluations for all the variants and compare the results. 

d. Steps for batch experimentation using python SDK:
1) Open batchRunEvaluations.ipynb notebook in the financial transcripts folder and run through cells. Note: to setup the configs for the batch experimentation runs, you may modify run_config.yaml file for the last section in the notebook. 

e. Steps for docker deployment:
1) Change directory to sample folder
2) Use the command below to recreate your llm app as a docker format:
```bash
pf flow build --source ./rag-copilot --output deploy --format docker
```
note that deploy folder is where the llm app is packaged. 

2) Inspect the requirement.txt file in the 'deploy/flow' directory. If empty, please manually add all the python packages from the environment.yaml file located at the root directory.

3) Inspect the connection files in the 'deploy/connections' and double-check information such as api_base and api_version.

4) Build the docker image file:
```docker build deploy -t rag-app-serve```
5) Run with docker run. Make sure to add secret values in the command below:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e AOAI_CONNECTION_API_KEY=<secret-value> -e ACS_CONNECTION_API_KEY=<secret-value> rag-app-serve
```
note the port mapping and change if needed. 
6) Finally inspect the end point. 
In you local machine, you may inspect your app in a browser: http://localhost:8080/
